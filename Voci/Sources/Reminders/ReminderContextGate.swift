// Sources/Reminders/ReminderContextGate.swift — voice-suppression gate (contract §B, T072).
// Constitution I / the contract's explicit instruction: "fail toward SUPPRESSED when unsure."
// Every concrete signal below either (a) produces a definite true/false from a public,
// no-extra-entitlement API, or (b) is an injectable extension point that defaults to "no signal"
// (not suppressing on that axis alone) until something wires it — see the doc comment on each
// property for exactly which is which, and this task's final report for what's left unwired.
