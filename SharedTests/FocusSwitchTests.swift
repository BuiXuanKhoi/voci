// Tests/FocusSwitchTests.swift — XCTest coverage for the "Switch" (đổi gió) action added to
// `Sources/App/AppState.swift`: `AppState.nextSwitchTarget(excluding:from:now:calendar:)` (the pure
// replacement-task selector), the `switchFocusTask()`/`canSwitchFocusTask` wiring behind
// `Sources/Views/FocusOverlay.swift`'s "Switch" button, the `switchDashboardActiveTask()`/
// `canSwitchDashboardActiveTask`/`dashboardActiveTask` wiring behind `Sources/Views/TodayView.swift`'s
// hero-card "Switch" button, and the shared FR-030 tail both paths run through
// (`recordSwitchAway`/`maybeOfferBreakdown` bumping `switchAwayCount` and arming the one-time
// breakdown suggestion).
//
// Anh Khôi chốt 2026-07-15 (backlog (l)): Switch must be a first-class action, equal in standing to
// "Mark done", with completely non-judgmental behavior. FR-030 (spec.md:280) additionally requires
// counting switches (`switchAwayCount`, NEVER surfaced to the user) and a one-time-only breakdown
// invite once a task crosses 3. Every "switch succeeded" test below asserts the task being LEFT is
// unchanged in every field EXCEPT `switchAwayCount` (`XCTAssertEqual` on the whole `TaskItem`, which
// is `Equatable`, against an explicitly-bumped copy) — never `status`, never anything else.
// `nextSwitchTarget` itself is pure (no `Date()`/`Calendar.current` read inside; `now`/`calendar` are
// always parameters — repo convention, see `VolarCore.nextTask`'s and `TaskSections.swift`'s own doc
// comments), so it is tested directly with no `AppState` involved at all for the pure-function cases.
//
// UNVERIFIED (written entirely on Windows — no Xcode/simulator available here): confirm on Mac that
// `xcodegen generate` + `xcodebuild test` discovers and runs this file under the `VolarTests`
// target, same as every other file already in this directory.
