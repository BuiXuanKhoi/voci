// Volar/ShareExtension/ShareViewController.swift — the macOS Share Extension ("Volar" in any
// share sheet: Safari, Mail, Notes, Preview…).
//
// WHY THIS IS TINY, AND WHY THERE IS NO APP GROUP: the backlog entry for this originally assumed a
// shared container — extension writes, app reads. It doesn't need one. `volar://capture` already
// exists, is already registered, and already routes into the confirm-card-gated capture pipeline
// (`AppLinkHandler.onCapture` → `AppState.proceedToCapture`). So the extension's entire job is:
// pull text off the share, percent-encode it into that URL, hand it to the system, and get out of
// the way. No shared container, no entitlement pairing on the developer portal, no second copy of
// any parsing or storage code. See `docs/url-scheme.md` for the user-facing side of the same door.
//
// SCREEN-PRESENT, SO CONFIRM-CARD-GATED: the user just picked "Volar" out of a share sheet with
// their own hand. Eyes on screen, one glance is cheap, a mis-parsed date is catchable. Same rule as
// the Services menu, and deliberately different from Siri/Shortcuts (`Shared/Intents/`), which read
// the parse back aloud because nobody is looking. The rule is "show what you parsed through the
// channel the user is actually on" — see `Shared/Intents/IntentBridge.swift`'s header.
//
// NO UI ON PURPOSE: a share extension may present a compose sheet. This one doesn't — a second
// window to dismiss is exactly the context switch Volar exists to avoid, and Volar's own confirm
// card is about to appear anyway. Two review surfaces back-to-back would be worse than one.
//
// UNVERIFIED, and one specific thing to check first on the Mac: `NSExtensionContext.open(_:)` is
// the sanctioned way for an app extension to hand a URL to the system (`NSWorkspace` is not
// available to extensions). If it turns out to be refused for a share extension under the sandbox,
// the fallback is the app-group route this file was written to avoid — write the text to a shared
// container and have the main app drain it on activate. Do not reach for that fallback until the
// simple path has actually been observed to fail.
