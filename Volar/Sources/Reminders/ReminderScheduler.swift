// Sources/Reminders/ReminderScheduler.swift — durable reminder scheduling + fire-time delivery
// (specs/002-workflow-command-center/contracts/phase4-contract.md §A, constitution IV, T029).
//
// PERSISTENCE DESIGN NOTE: this scheduler owns its own `ModelContainer`/`ModelContext` for
// `ReminderRecord`, kept separate from `TaskStore`'s container (`Sources/Model/TaskStore.swift`,
// schema `[VolarTask.self, CompletionEvent.self, ParseCorrection.self]`). This task owns
// `Model/ReminderRecord.swift` but explicitly not `TaskStore.swift`, so extending TaskStore's
// schema/init wasn't an option without touching a file outside this task's ownership. A single
// shared container would be a reasonable future consolidation (worth a backlog line — flagged in
// this task's final report rather than written to `backlog.md` directly, per this task's "do not
// edit backlog" constraint) but is NOT required for correctness: `ReminderRecord` rows are just as
// durable in their own named SwiftData store, and `rebuildFromStorage()` reconciles against
// `TaskStore.fetchAll()` regardless of which container either side lives in.
