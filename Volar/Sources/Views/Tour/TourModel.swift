// Sources/Views/Tour/TourModel.swift — pure data model for the first-run guided coach-mark tour
// (`TourOverlay.swift`). Deliberately free of SwiftUI/AppKit imports so `TourStop.all` and its
// content can be exercised by `Tests/TourFlowTests.swift` with zero UI/store/EventKit dependencies
// — the same "pure model, tested without the view" split this codebase already uses for
// `ReminderRecord.derive`/`ReminderPolicy` (see `Sources/Reminders/Recurrence.swift`).

/// Which real, on-screen UI element a tour stop spotlights — resolved to an actual `CGRect` via
/// `TourAnchorKey`'s anchor-preference plumbing (`TourAnchor.swift`), never a hardcoded frame. Four
/// cases instead of a bare `String`/enum-per-view-file because the SAME identifier has to be
/// produced by `.tourAnchor(_:)` call sites scattered across `Sidebar.swift`/`TodayView.swift` and
/// consumed by `TourOverlay.swift` — a shared, exhaustively-checked enum is what keeps those two
/// sides from drifting apart silently (a typo'd raw string would just silently fail to resolve).
///
/// `.focusPrimary`/`.focusFallback` exist as a PAIR for the same stop (see `TourStop.all`'s "focus"
/// stop below) because the "Start focus" button `.focusPrimary` tags only renders once a task is
/// actually eligible for the NOW spotlight (`TodayView.nowSpotlight`'s `if let active =
/// appState.activeTask` branch) — a brand-new user with zero tasks, or a user whose engine has
/// nothing eligible, never renders it at all. `.focusFallback` tags the "Focus" button inside
/// `frogPill`, which DOES render in that empty/no-eligible-task state (`TodayView.frogPill` has no
/// such guard), so the tour still has something real to point at instead of silently falling back
/// to a centered, anchor-less card that would read as a UI bug rather than a deliberate choice.
