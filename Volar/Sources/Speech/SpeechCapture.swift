///
/// ## Ownership & bridging (for Phase 2C `HotkeyManager` / Phase 3 `VolarApp` wiring)
/// `HotkeyManager` should own exactly one `SpeechCapture` for the app's lifetime (creating a new
/// `SFSpeechRecognizer` + `AVAudioEngine` pair per keypress is wasteful and can hit rate limits).
/// This type intentionally has **no dependency on `AppState`** — per the Phase 2 split in
/// `docs/app-architecture.md`, `Speech/` stays decoupled from `App/`; the caller bridges partials
/// and completion into `AppState`. Intended wiring, once the ⌃⌥M toggle-capture hotkey fires:
///
/// ```swift
/// // once, at HotkeyManager init:
/// speechCapture.onFinal = { final in appState.finishRecording(transcript: final) }
/// speechCapture.onError = { _ in appState.captureState = .error }
///
/// // first press (toggle -> start):
/// appState.startCapture()                       // -> .recording; clears liveTranscript/parsed
/// Task {
///     guard await speechCapture.requestAuthorization() else {
///         appState.captureState = .error
///         return
///     }
///     speechCapture.start(onPartial: { partial in appState.liveTranscript = partial })
/// }
///
/// // second press (toggle -> stop):
/// speechCapture.stop()   // triggers one last final result -> onFinal -> finishRecording(transcript:)
/// ```
///
/// ## Concurrency bridging (UNVERIFIED — please double-check on the Mac/Xcode 26 toolchain)
/// This type is `@MainActor` (all its stored state — engine/request/task refs, `isRunning` — is
/// only ever touched from the main actor). Two system callbacks do NOT run on the main actor and
/// must not touch `self` or MainActor-isolated state directly:
///   1. `AVAudioNode.installTap` block runs on a realtime audio thread. It must stay
///      allocation-light and non-blocking, so it captures only the local `SFSpeechAudioBufferRecognitionRequest`
///      (via `nonisolated(unsafe) let`, since that system class isn't `Sendable` but
///      `append(_:)` is documented safe to call from any thread while streaming) and calls only
///      `append(buffer:)` — it never reaches back into `self`.
///   2. `SFSpeechRecognizer.recognitionTask`'s result handler is invoked on an arbitrary
///      non-main queue. It captures `self` weakly (`nonisolated(unsafe) weak var` boxing avoided by
///      hopping immediately) and re-enters the main actor via `Task { @MainActor in ... }` before
///      touching `self` or invoking the caller-supplied `onPartial`/`onFinal`/`onError` closures —
///      those are expected to feed `AppState`, a `@MainActor` type.
/// If the Xcode 26 SDK has tightened `AVAudioNodeTapBlock` / the recognition-task closure to
/// require full `Sendable` closures (or `@Sendable` capture lists), the `nonisolated(unsafe)`
/// local-let workaround below is the intended escape hatch — narrow it further (e.g. wrap in a
/// dedicated `@unchecked Sendable` box type) if the compiler still objects on Mac.
