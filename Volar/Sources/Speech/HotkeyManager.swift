import Carbon.HIToolbox

/// Registers TWO system-wide hotkeys using Carbon's `RegisterEventHotKey`/`InstallEventHandler`:
/// ⌃⌥M ("press to toggle voice capture — press to start, press again to stop", unchanged since the
/// pre-second-hotkey version of this file) and ⌃⌥T ("open the typed-capture popup", new — see
/// `docs`/the task brief for "type → Add task → done"). Both share the same `InstallEventHandler`
/// registration (one handler, `kEventHotKeyPressed`/`kEventHotKeyReleased`, covers every hotkey
/// registered against `GetApplicationEventTarget()`) but each gets its OWN `RegisterEventHotKey`
/// call and its own `EventHotKeyRef` — see `start()`/`stop()` below for why that independence
/// matters (one hotkey's registration failing must never disable the other).
///
/// Why Carbon at all (unchanged rationale): `NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents` only delivers
/// events system-wide once the user has granted **Accessibility** permission, which is unacceptable
/// under Mac App Store review + App Sandbox (Volar.entitlements sets `com.apple.security.app-sandbox`).
/// `RegisterEventHotKey` is a first-class Carbon Event Manager API: sandbox-legal, needs no
/// permission prompt at all, and fires uniformly regardless of which app is frontmost, INCLUDING
/// Volar itself.
///
/// Public API is UNCHANGED from the single-hotkey version: same class name, same
/// `start(appState:onKeyDown:onKeyUp:)` / `stop()` signatures. `AppState.activateServices()` (the
/// only call site, `hotkey.start(appState: self)`, no closures) needs no changes — ⌃⌥T's dispatch
/// target is reached by calling `appState.openTextCapture()` directly from `handle(hotKeyID:isKeyDown:)`
/// below, the exact same pattern ⌃⌥M already used for `appState.handleHotkey()`. `onKeyDown`/
/// `onKeyUp` remain ⌃⌥M-only (never invoked for ⌃⌥T) — mirrors ⌃⌥M's own pre-existing "onKeyUp is
/// stored but intentionally never invoked" behavior (toggle mode never needed it either).
///
/// UNVERIFIED (authored on a Windows machine with no Xcode/Carbon to compile against — verify on
/// Mac): `import Carbon.HIToolbox` availability/name, `EventHandlerUPP`'s exact Swift-imported
/// closure signature, `EventTypeSpec`'s memberwise-init argument labels, whether
/// `GetApplicationEventTarget()`/`GetEventKind()` return optionals, that none of the Carbon Event
/// Manager hot-key APIs used here are deprecated-and-removed on the macOS 14 SDK floor, AND (new to
/// this file) the exact `GetEventParameter(..., kEventParamDirectObject, typeEventHotKeyID, ...)`
/// call shape used in `carbonEventHandler` below to identify which of the two hotkeys fired — this
/// is a widely-used Carbon idiom (the standard way to read an `EventHotKeyID` back out of a hotkey
/// event) but has never been compiled against a real Carbon.HIToolbox header on this machine.
