// Sources/Speech/MicrophonePermission.swift — the ONE place that asks macOS for microphone access
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: `SpeechCapture`, `GroqEngine`, and `WhisperKitEngine` each used to call
// `AVAudioApplication.requestRecordPermission()` directly. `AVAudioApplication` is an iOS 17+ /
// Mac Catalyst API — on native macOS it is NOT the API that drives the microphone TCC prompt, so
// calling it there silently does nothing: it returns without ever showing the system "Volar would
// like to access the microphone" sheet. The correct native-macOS API is `AVCaptureDevice` (also
// AVFoundation, just a different type): `authorizationStatus(for: .audio)` to read the cached
// decision, and `requestAccess(for: .audio)` to actually trigger the one-time TCC prompt.
//
// Do NOT read this as "the old code never prompted at all" — on the first real-Mac run a mic sheet
// DID appear, because macOS also prompts on its own the moment an app actually touches the input
// hardware (`AVAudioEngine`'s input tap in `SpeechCapture`, `AVAudioRecorder.record()` in
// `GroqEngine`). What the old code could not do is prompt DELIBERATELY, up front, before capture —
// or report a trustworthy answer, which is what `SpeechCapture.requestAuthorization()`'s `guard`
// and Settings ▸ Permissions both depend on. That is what this file fixes.
//
// Centralized here (rather than fixed inline at each of the 3 call sites) so there is exactly one
// place that knows which AVFoundation type is the real macOS entry point — the next engine added
// to this app should never have a chance to reintroduce the `AVAudioApplication` mistake.
