// Shared/Intents/VolarAppIntents.swift — the three App Intents, and the Shortcuts phrases for them.
//
// WHY APP INTENTS AND NOT N INTEGRATIONS (backlog "Đường vào Volar", anh Khôi chốt 2026-08-17):
// writing these three unlocks Shortcuts, Siri, Spotlight (macOS 14+), Focus-mode automation and —
// once the iOS target ships — the Action Button and widgets, from one API. That is the whole point:
// the user wires Volar into a workflow we never predicted, instead of us guessing ten integrations
// and shipping nine nobody uses. It is also why this file lives in `Shared/` rather than
// `Volar/Sources/` — `project.yml` compiles `../Shared` into every Apple target, so iOS inherits
// all three untouched when its turn comes. Nothing here is macOS-specific.
//
// NOTHING IN THIS FILE PARSES OR SAVES ANYTHING. Every intent goes through
// `AppState.captureFromIntent` / `startFocus()` / `activeTask` — see `IntentBridge.swift` for why
// that indirection exists and what the read-back contract is.
//
// UNVERIFIED: written on Windows with no Swift toolchain. Not compiled, not run. Build on the Mac
// before believing any of it. Specifically worth checking there: whether Shortcuts picks the
// phrases up on first launch (they are registered at app launch, and the Shortcuts app is known to
// cache aggressively — a rebuild plus a Shortcuts relaunch is usually needed to see them).
