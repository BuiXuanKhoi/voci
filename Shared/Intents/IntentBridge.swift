// Shared/Intents/IntentBridge.swift — the seam App Intents reach the running app through.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (and why it is this small): every App Intent in `VolarAppIntents.swift`
// needs two things — a reference to the one live `AppState`, and a way to hand text to the capture
// pipeline that returns an OUTCOME it can read back to the user. Neither existed, and neither
// belongs inside the 6000-line `AppState.swift`. Nothing here re-implements parsing, saving,
// scheduling, or syncing: `captureFromIntent` drives the exact same two properties + one method
// (`textCaptureInput` / `submitTextCapture()` / `textCapture`) that `TextCapturePanel` already
// drives, so an intent capture and a typed capture are literally the same code path.
//
// THE CONFIRM RULE, restated for headless surfaces (anh Khôi chốt 2026-08-17):
// every capture must show the user WHAT IT PARSED, through whichever channel the user is actually
// present on. On screen that is the confirm card. On Siri that is the spoken read-back this file's
// `IntentCaptureOutcome.saved(titles:)` carries. `docs/app-links.md`'s "never bypasses the confirm
// card" is unchanged for `volar://capture` — this is a different surface with a different channel,
// not an exemption.
//
// Crucially, the simple-vs-complex split this needs ALREADY EXISTS and was not invented here:
// `AppState.applyTextCaptureParseResult` (Việc 4, 2026-07-28 "chỉ đi qua confirm khi phức tạp")
// auto-saves a lone, unambiguous, condition-free draft and hands anything else to the confirm card.
// `captureFromIntent` simply reports which of the two happened, so Siri can say "added" or "needs
// your confirmation in Volar" instead of lying.
//
// UNVERIFIED: written on Windows with no Swift toolchain (see CLAUDE.md build-env note). Not
// compiled, not run. Every symbol referenced below was grepped out of the current tree first
// (`textCapture`, `textCaptureInput`, `submitTextCapture()`, `captureState`, `activeTask`,
// `frogTask`, `focusActive`, `focusSecondsLeft`, `startFocus()`), but the build must be confirmed
// on the Mac before anyone claims this works.
