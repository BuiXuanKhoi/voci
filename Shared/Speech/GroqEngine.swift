// Sources/Speech/GroqEngine.swift — Groq (cloud, paid tier) batch transcription engine
import Foundation
import AVFoundation

/// Cloud transcription via Groq Speech-to-Text — the paid tier of the freemium speech design
/// (backlog: on-device WhisperKit = free, Groq = paid). A **batch** `SpeechEngine`: it records the
/// whole utterance to a temp AAC file, then on `stop()` uploads it and delivers a single final
/// transcript through `onFinal`. No interim results (`supportsPartialResults == false`).
///
/// Model strategy (backlog "★ KIẾN TRÚC CHỐT"): `whisper-large-v3` primary for best vi↔en
/// code-switching; on a *server-side (5xx) or transport* failure it falls back once to
/// `whisper-large-v3-turbo` (cheaper/faster) rather than failing the capture outright. Language:
/// `languageCode` (set by `AppState` from Settings' Recognition-language picker) is forwarded as
/// Groq's ISO-639-1 `language` hint on every request; the picker's "Automatic (multilingual)"
/// choice leaves `languageCode` nil so the client sends no `language` field and Groq auto-detects
/// instead — short clips auto-detect poorly, so a fixed locale should be preferred when known.
///
/// Scope note: NOT yet wired into `AppState`/`PopoverView` (that's the tier-routing + StoreKit
/// epic). It conforms to `SpeechEngine` so the capture flow can route to it later exactly as it
/// does the on-device engine.
