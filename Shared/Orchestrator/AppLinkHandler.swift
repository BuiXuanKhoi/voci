// Sources/Orchestrator/AppLinkHandler.swift — inbound `volar://` app-link routing (US4,
// specs/002-workflow-command-center/contracts/phase6-contract.md §A +
// specs/002-workflow-command-center/contracts/app-links.md, the authoritative behavioral spec).
//
// URL SCHEME: `volar` — confirmed in Volar/Resources/Info.plist's `CFBundleURLTypes` (the project
// was renamed Voci -> Volar; that Info.plist comment already documents that nothing implements
// `.onOpenURL` yet, i.e. this file is that missing handler). This file does not hard-fail on a
// different scheme (SwiftUI's `.onOpenURL` only ever routes URLs matching a registered scheme in
// the first place) but does log+ignore one, defensively, rather than assume the caller pre-filtered.
//
// CAPTURE SEAM: per this task's instructions, capture parsing itself is NOT implemented here
// (`volar://capture?text=...&source=...` must "hand text to the existing capture pipeline" without
// bypassing the confirm card — app-links.md). This file exposes `onCapture`, a closure the
// app-wiring agent sets in `AppState`/`VolarApp.swift` to the existing entry point
// (`AppState.proceedToCapture(transcript:)` per `Volar/Sources/App/AppState.swift`, which already
// runs transcripts through the parser + confirm-card flow — see that file's `finishRecording`/
// `proceedToCapture`). Leaving this file free of any UI/AppState import keeps it testable in
// isolation and keeps this task's file ownership to exactly the two Orchestrator files.
