// Sources/Model/TaskStore.swift — SwiftData ModelContainer + CRUD, mapped VolarTask <-> TaskItem.
// Enforces data-model.md's 6 persistence validation rules; everything else (VolarCore's own
// invariants — DAG-ness of `.taskDone` edges, ordering, eligibility) is delegated to VolarCore.
//
// TRUST BOUNDARY (self-review "client-side exploitable holes"): validation here runs on the
// WRITE path (`add`/`addBatch`/`addCondition`/`setRecurrence`/`setParent`). A store row edited
// directly on disk (hostile plist/db edit, cross-device sync corruption) bypasses all of it — the
// read path (`fetchAll`) does not re-validate `.taskDone` acyclicity or re-check the 10-task cap,
// both for cost (O(n) validateCondition-equivalent work on every launch) and because VolarCore's
// hot path (`nextTask`) is documented to tolerate a corrupted snapshot without crashing (dangling
// ids resolve as "satisfied", per contract). What IS defended unconditionally, including against
// a corrupted store: `ModelContext.parentId` cycle walks below always terminate (visited-set
// bounded), and JSON blob decode failures fail closed to empty/`nil` rather than throwing.
