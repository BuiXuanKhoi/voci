// Sources/Account/AccountService.swift — Supabase Auth over plain URLSession.
//
// WHY NO supabase-swift SPM PACKAGE: this app has never once been compiled (Windows dev machine,
// no Swift/Xcode toolchain here — see repo convention). Adding a large dependency tree with its
// own Swift 6 concurrency surface is a risk this session cannot evaluate at all (we'd be trusting
// that package's actor/Sendable story compiles clean on a toolchain we can't run). We need exactly
// 5 endpoints (contract §2) — hand-rolling them with `URLSession`, matching the existing
// `GroqTranscriptionClient.swift`/`CloudParser.swift` pattern (struct/actor, injected session,
// typed error enum, no hardcoded secrets), keeps the risk surface to "did I call 5 URLs right"
// instead of "does a third-party package's whole concurrency model compile."
//
// specs/002-workflow-command-center/contracts/account-auth.md is the CHỐT design — every endpoint,
// header, and status code below matches it exactly.
