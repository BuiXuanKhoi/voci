// Sources/Integrations/CalendarSync.swift — one-way (Volar → Calendar) task mirroring into a
// dedicated, app-created "Volar" calendar. Shares `CalendarAccess`'s single `EKEventStore`
// instance (see that file's header) rather than constructing its own.
//
// THE CORE SAFETY PROPERTY THIS FILE EXISTS TO GUARANTEE: Volar must never MUTATE (write, modify,
// or delete) anything in a calendar it did not itself create — and, specifically in THIS file,
// never read individual event content from any calendar either (that stays scoped to
// `CalendarAccess.swift`'s bare calendar *count*, which is metadata about calendars as a whole, not
// their contents; see that file for why even that narrow read is fine to keep).
// `requestFullAccessToEvents()` (`CalendarAccess.swift`) grants EventKit permission across EVERY
// calendar on the Mac — there is no OS-level way to scope that grant down to just one calendar. So
// the scoping has to happen in THIS code, structurally, not by trusting the OS: every write path
// below goes through TWO independent ownership guards before it will touch an existing `EKEvent`:
//   1. `event.calendar?.calendarIdentifier == volarCalendarID` — the event must live in the exact
//      calendar `ensureVolarCalendar()` created (identified by its stable EventKit identifier, not
//      by title — titles are user-editable and could collide with a calendar the user made
//      themselves called "Volar").
//   2. `event.url == markerURL(for: taskID)` — the event must carry the `volar://task/<uuid>`
//      marker this file itself stamped onto it when creating it.
// Either guard failing means "this is not an event Volar created" and the code drops it from
// `eventMap` and creates a fresh replacement instead of ever calling `save`/`remove` on it. This is
// what makes it structurally impossible (not just policy) for a stale/tampered/id-reused
// `eventMap` entry to cause Volar to mutate a foreign event — see `reconcile(tasks:)` for both
// guards in the create/update path and `removeAllMirroredEvents()` for the same guards in the
// delete path.
//
// SYNC DIRECTION: strictly one-way, Volar's own tasks → the "Volar" calendar. Volar never reads
// event titles/times/attendees/notes from any calendar to create or modify a task — that would be
// a materially different (and separately scoped) feature. `reconcile(tasks:)` is a pure "make the
// Volar calendar's contents match this task list" operation; it never feeds anything back into
// `TaskItem`/`TaskStore`.
//
// WHY `eventMap` LIVES IN USERDEFAULTS, NOT ON `VolarTask` (SwiftData): `VolarTask.swift`'s own
// header explains this project has never declared a `VersionedSchema`/`SchemaMigrationPlan` and
// treats that as fragile enough to avoid except when unavoidable. Adding an `eventIdentifier`
// field to that model for what is entirely REBUILDABLE derived data (if this map were lost
// entirely, the worst case is `reconcile` orphaning old events until `removeAllMirroredEvents`
// cleans them up, and creating fresh ones with fresh identifiers) would be introducing exactly the
// kind of schema churn that file's migration strategy exists to avoid, for data that was never
// worth the risk. Keeping it in UserDefaults — the same idiom `AppState.swift` already uses for
// every other piece of small persisted app state (`ambientKey`/`accentKey`/etc.) — costs nothing
// and keeps the SwiftData schema untouched.
//
// WHY NO `EKAlarm`: Volar has its own reminder subsystem (`Sources/Reminders/ReminderScheduler.swift`
// et al., contracts/phase4-contract.md) that already schedules local notifications/voice reminders
// for every dated task. Adding a system Calendar alert on top of that would double-notify the user
// for the same deadline through two independent paths — a real user-facing bug, not a nice-to-have
// extra. `reconcile(tasks:)` never sets `event.addAlarm(...)` for this reason.
//
// WHY `@MainActor`: same reason as `CalendarAccess` — `EKEventStore`/`EKEvent`/`EKCalendar` are not
// `Sendable`, and this target builds with `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY: complete` under Swift 6.
