// Sources/Integrations/CalendarAccess.swift — EventKit permission surface: requests access and
// reports STATUS + a bare calendar count. Actually reading/writing event data is NOT this file's
// job — see `CalendarSync.swift` (same module, shares this class's `eventStore`) for that.
//
// SCOPE (updated — Volar now writes calendar events, see below): this file itself still only ever
// touches `store.calendars(for: .event).count`, a bare integer — it never reads event titles,
// times, attendees, locations, or any other event content, and never calls an EventKit mutator
// itself. What changed is what the REST of the app does with the grant this file obtains:
// `CalendarSync` (sibling file) now creates a dedicated "Volar" calendar and mirrors the user's own
// scheduled tasks into it as events — one-way, Volar → Calendar, never the reverse (reading events
// to create tasks is explicitly out of scope). `CalendarSync` never touches any calendar it did not
// create; see that file's header and `ensureVolarCalendar()`/`reconcile(tasks:)` for the mechanism
// that bounds the blast radius to just that one calendar. `AppState.busyIntervals` (task-engine
// scheduling awareness) stays hardcoded `[]` regardless — mirroring INTO the calendar and reading
// FROM it for scheduling are two separate, independently-gated features, and only the former exists
// today.
//
// WHY THIS REQUESTS "FULL" ACCESS (read this before touching the usage strings, entitlement, or
// privacy doc — all three must make the same claim this file backs up): EventKit on macOS 14
// exposes exactly two request calls: `requestFullAccessToEvents()` and
// `requestWriteOnlyAccessToEvents()`. There is no `requestReadOnlyAccessToEvents` — the write-only
// grant cannot be used to read a single event or even list calendars for reading. So the ONLY
// EventKit API that grants read access on this OS version is "full access," which also happens to
// be exactly what Volar now genuinely needs, since it both reads (calendar count today, busy
// intervals possibly later) and writes (via `CalendarSync`, into its own calendar only). "Requests
// full access, uses it read-only" is no longer the story for this app as a whole — but the write
// half is scoped to a single app-created calendar by construction, never to calendars the user
// already had. If a future macOS adds a finer-grained request API, revisit this file, the two
// usage-description strings (Info.plist), and `docs/app-store-privacy.md` together.
//
// WHY `@MainActor`: `EKEventStore` is not `Sendable`, and this target builds with
// `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY: complete` under Swift 6 (see VolarApp.swift's own `@Sendable` notes
// for a case where this repo got bitten by assuming a closure was MainActor-isolated when it
// wasn't — same class of bug this annotation exists to prevent here). Pinning the whole class to
// the main actor means the store, and every property callers read (`status`, `calendarCount`,
// `lastError`), are always touched from one isolation domain — no `Task.detached`, no hopping
// across actors with a non-Sendable store in hand. `CalendarSync` is `@MainActor` too and shares
// THIS `eventStore` instance rather than constructing its own, so there is exactly one
// `EKEventStore` in the whole app — two instances would maintain separate internal caches that can
// go stale/conflict relative to each other (Apple's own docs warn against this).
