// Sources/Design/Theme.swift — frozen design tokens: palette, accents, density, glass (spec §3)
//
// RETHEME 4 — "Volar Paper" (2026-08-19, specs/009-light-mode-list-v2/design.md). Supersedes
// RETHEME 3 "Volar Graphite" on every color VALUE; token NAMES are unchanged yet again (71 call
// sites across 26 files keep compiling untouched — see design.md §2). Two real changes:
//
// 1. LIGHT MODE EXISTS NOW. Every `VolarColor` static let (and every `VolarAccent` case) is a
//    dynamic color that resolves differently under light vs. dark appearance, via
//    `NSColor(name:dynamicProvider:)` on macOS / `UIColor { traits in }` on iOS (`Shared/` is
//    compiled by both `Volar` and `VolarIOS`, so both branches must be correct — see the
//    `Color(volarLight:dark:)` initializer below). `veil(_:)` is the load-bearing case: it flips
//    from a white film (dark) to a BLACK film (light) so the ~70 call sites that build hover
//    tints / chip fills / progress tracks out of `veil(x)` still read correctly on a white page.
//    Previously this file was dark-only ("no light variant exists" — that claim is now false).
//
// 2. THE ACCENT IS PURPLE, NOT MINT. `VolarAccent.indigo` (the default; name is a persisted
//    misnomer, unchanged) now resolves to Apple's `systemPurple` family (accessible light variant
//    `#8944AB` / dark `#BF5AF2`) instead of ice blue. Mint (`nowAccent` family) keeps its token
//    names but ALSO now resolves to the same purple — mint the hue is retired from UI entirely and
//    lives on only in the logo mark (untouched, tracked separately in backlog.md per design.md §9).
//    The rule "one saturated color on screen at a time" still holds, it's just purple now: a 3px
//    bar + a small chip, never a large fill (see `nowSurface`, new token, §3.4). `instrument`
//    (ice-blue readout accent) is retired too — it now equals `textSec` (no color).
