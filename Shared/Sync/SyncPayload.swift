// UNVERIFIED: written on Windows, never compiled.
//
// WHY `TaskPayload` IS NOT `TaskItem`: `TaskItem` isn't `Codable`, and more importantly the wire
// shape must change SLOWER than the in-app shape (design.md §7 — the model has already changed 6
// times in 3 weeks). `TaskPayload` is a field-for-field mirror, decoded defensively (every field
// via `decodeIfPresent` with a fallback, same convention `ReminderPolicy`'s hand-rolled `Codable`
// already uses in `Recurrence.swift`) so a payload written by an OLDER or NEWER build — missing a
// field this build expects, or carrying one this build has never heard of — still decodes into
// *something* instead of taking down the whole record. See `SyncClient.swift` for the second,
// batch-level layer of the same tolerance (one bad row must not lose every other row in the page).
