// Shared/Sync/SyncClient.swift — thin networking actor for `POST /rest/v1/rpc/sync_exchange`.
//
// UNVERIFIED: written on Windows, never compiled.
//
// Mirrors `AccountService.swift`'s hand-rolled `URLSession` shape (plain `actor`, injected
// session, base URL + publishable key declared locally — same convention `Entitlements.swift`
// also follows rather than sharing a single constant, per this repo's existing precedent) rather
// than reusing any of `AccountService`'s private networking helpers directly (they're `private` to
// that actor) or pulling in a Supabase SPM package (constitution/repo-wide: this app has never
// once compiled, so a large third-party dependency's own concurrency surface is an unreviewable
// risk — see `AccountService.swift`'s own header for the fuller argument).
//
// JUDGMENT CALL not spelled out by the contract: request/response bodies here are built via
// `Codable` + `SyncCoding`'s `JSONEncoder`/`JSONDecoder` (configured to route every `Date` through
// `SyncDate`), NOT via `AccountService`'s `[String: Any]` + `JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject:)`
// idiom. That idiom fits AccountService's few flat, simple bodies; `sync_exchange`'s body is
// nested arrays of `TaskPayload`/`CompletionPayload` with ~25 fields each, where hand-building
// dictionaries would be exactly the kind of place a stray key typo goes unnoticed until a Mac
// build. Still "hand-rolled `URLSession`, no SPM package" — the deviation is in how the BODY is
// serialized, not in how the request is sent.
//
// PRIVACY (design.md §9): `payload` carries `title`/`notes`/`sourceTranscript` — verbatim spoken
// text. Nothing in this file ever logs/prints a request or response body, only status codes and
// already-classified `SyncFailure` values.
