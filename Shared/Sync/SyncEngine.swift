// Shared/Sync/SyncEngine.swift — schedules and drives `sync_exchange` rounds; the only file in
// `Shared/Sync/` that touches `TaskStore` (via `SyncTaskStoring`) or a live clock.
//
// UNVERIFIED: written on Windows, never compiled.
//
// ARCHITECTURE NOTE (Opus, per this task's brief — design.md §7 says "actor", this splits it in
// two): `SyncClient` is the `actor` — networking runs off-main, matching design intent. This type
// is `@MainActor` instead, because it has to touch `TaskStore` (a `@MainActor` class) directly.
// Under `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY: complete`, passing a live `TaskStore` across an actor boundary
// buys a whole layer of Sendable errors nobody on this (Windows, no Swift toolchain) machine can
// verify. `SyncTaskStoring` (`SyncContracts.swift`) only ever hands `Sendable` VALUE types
// (`PendingTask`/`RemoteTask`/...) across the one real boundary this file crosses — into `SyncClient`
// — so the store itself never needs to leave `@MainActor`.
//
// GOVERNING PRINCIPLE for anything added to this file later (Opus, 2026-08-10, after anh Khôi's
// mid-task revision below): IF a future change adds push notifications or Supabase Realtime on top
// of this, that channel may ONLY ever be a "something changed, go pull" hint — NEVER a carrier of
// record content. A device that's offline the instant a push fires would lose that record forever
// if the content itself rode the push; missing a mere SIGNAL costs nothing, because the next poll's
// cursor pull still catches everything. Cursor pull stays the ONE source of truth for content,
// always — never build a second read path that has to agree with it.
//
// SCHEDULING (client-contract.md §8, revised 2026-08-10 — anh Khôi: 5-minute foreground polling
// read as "the app isn't working" when machine A finished a task and machine B still showed it
// pending): foreground poll interval starts at `baseInterval` (30s) and backs off exponentially
// toward `maxInterval` (300s) after `quietRoundsBeforeBackoff` consecutive rounds pull nothing new
// — so a machine actively in use (edited within the last couple of polls) stays fast, and only a
// machine left open and genuinely idle drifts slow. Polling runs ONLY while foreground; going to
// background cancels it outright rather than letting it free-run — see `handleBackground()`.
// Deliberately NOT applied to watch (no watch target exists yet — Phase 3): LTE + a 30s poll would
// drain a standalone watch's battery by lunchtime, so whatever watch code eventually lands here
// must stay activate-based, never on this timer.
