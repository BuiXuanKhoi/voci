// Shared/Sync/SyncAccountState.swift — account-level sync toggle + rejects reader.
//
// UNVERIFIED: written on Windows, never compiled — no Swift/Xcode toolchain on this dev machine.
//
// Group C (specs/008-sync/client-contract.md §0). Hand-rolled `URLSession`, same shape as
// `Shared/Account/AccountService.swift` — no SPM package, matching that file's own reasoning (a
// large third-party dependency's Swift 6 concurrency story can't be evaluated from a machine that
// can't compile it). `SyncAccountClient` owns exactly the account-level surface: reading/setting
// the server-side sync toggle, purging server data, and reading `sync_rejects`. It does NOT own
// `sync_exchange` (push/pull) — that belongs to `SyncEngine` (group B, `Shared/Sync/SyncEngine.swift`).
//
// Base URL + apikey are COPIED from `AccountService`'s own constants, not re-derived — that file
// keeps them `private`, so there is no way to reach them from here. If the project's publishable
// key ever rotates, BOTH copies need the same edit. That's an accepted duplication (same trade
// `AccountService` itself made when it hand-rolled instead of centralizing this once behind a
// client library — see that file's own header comment), not a lookup bug.
//
// Types consumed here (`SyncState`, `SyncDevice`, `SyncReject`, `SyncFailure`) are pinned VERBATIM
// by client-contract.md §2 and owned by group B (`Shared/Sync/SyncContracts.swift`). This file only
// USES them — it never redefines or edits them. `SyncDate` (client-contract.md §6) is owned by
// group B too (`Shared/Sync/SyncPayload.swift`).
