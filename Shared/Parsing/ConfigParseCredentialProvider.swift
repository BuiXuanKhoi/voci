// Sources/Parsing/ConfigParseCredentialProvider.swift — account-token-backed cloud-parse
// credentials.
//
// UPDATED (specs/002-workflow-command-center/contracts/account-auth.md, 2026-07-26): this used to
// read a hand-typed `volar.parseProxyToken` from UserDefaults as a placeholder for the real
// StoreKit-JWS/DeviceCheck composite (see this file's git history). The contract supersedes that
// design entirely: EVERY cloud request (parse AND Groq) now carries a single
// `Authorization: Bearer <supabase access_token>` regardless of tier — the server looks up
// `entitlements.tier` by `user_id`, not by which client-side auth shape was sent. Free vs Pro is no
// longer decided here at all for `/parse` (contract §1: free = 20/day, pro = 500/day, BOTH tiers
// call the exact same route, just with different daily limits) — only Groq is tier-gated
// client-side (see `GroqTranscriptionClient.swift`'s `EnvironmentGroqCredentialProvider`).
//
// `CloudParser.swift` is NOT in this task's owned-files list and still only knows two header
// shapes: `.paidJWS(String)` -> `Authorization: Bearer <value>`, and `.freeDeviceToken(String)` ->
// `X-Device-Token: <value>`. The contract's single-bearer shape IS exactly `.paidJWS`'s wire
// behavior, so this file reuses that case purely to carry the account access token — the case
// NAME is now a misnomer ("paidJWS" no longer implies a paid tier), but its WIRE BEHAVIOR
// (`Authorization: Bearer <value>`) is exactly right, and renaming it would require editing a file
// out of this task's scope. Flagged here for whoever next has authority over `CloudParser.swift`.
//
// Base URL (unchanged): the Supabase project ref (`cjaamylayaylbuuhwlnz`) is fixed and checked
// into this file as `defaultBaseURL` — NOT a secret (every client of a Supabase project embeds its
// project ref/URL). `volar.parseProxyBaseURL` in UserDefaults still overrides it, useful for
// pointing at a local `supabase functions serve` during development.
